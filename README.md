# 🧪 Hardhat Journey: Smart Contracts on Local Ethereum Network

A collection of Solidity smart contracts deployed and tested using Hardhat. This repo marks my transition from theory to actual smart contract interaction on a development blockchain.
(this repo is in progress)

---

## 🔧 What's Inside

- ✅ Contract: `HelloWorld`
- ✅ Contract: `MyToken` (basic ERC-20 style logic)
- ✅ Scripts for deploying and interacting
- ✅ Local Hardhat node setup
- ✅ Clean folder structure

## 📁 Structure



---

## 📘 Learnings

- Deploying contracts with Hardhat scripts
- Writing and calling contract functions via ethers.js
- Fixing common errors in local environments
- Understanding artifacts and ABI interaction

---

## 🌱 Ongoing

This repo will continue to grow with:
- More advanced contracts (multi-owner, modifiers, structs)
- Unit testing with Chai
- Frontend integration (upcoming)
