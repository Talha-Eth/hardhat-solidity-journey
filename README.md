# ðŸ“˜ Blockchain JavaScript & Solidity Learning Journal

Tracking my journey to become a full-stack blockchain developer.

## ðŸš€ Progress Overview

| Day | Topics Covered |
|-----|----------------|
| Day 1 | JavaScript: Variables, arrays, template strings |
| Day 2 | Functions, if/else, loops |
| Day 3 | Objects, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, token logic |
| Day 4 | Promises, `async/await`, `try/catch`, contract simulation |
| Solidity Day 1 | âœ… Hardhat setup, Solidity contract, local deployment, state reading/writing |

---

## ðŸ§  Key Skills Learned

- âœ… Token simulation in JavaScript (`mint`, `transfer`, `burn`)
- âœ… Mastered Promises and `async/await` for blockchain-style calls
- âœ… Set up Git + GitHub for version control
- âœ… Installed and used Hardhat for modern smart contract dev
- âœ… Wrote, compiled, and deployed a real Solidity contract (`HelloWorld`)
- âœ… Interacted with contract using `ethers.js` in Hardhat console

## ðŸ§© Next Up (Solidity Day 2)

- Ownership and `msg.sender`
- `require()` and access control
- `constructor(args)`
